# REST-API

This is a basic REST API built to start exploring the area of web development.

The core objectives achieved here are:
  1. Create a API to display a message based on the parameters passed.
  2. Connect with an active database, here, MongoDB.
  3. Insert, Retrieve, Update and Delete documents from the database through the API endpoints.
